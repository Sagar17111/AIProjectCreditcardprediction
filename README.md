# AIProjectCreditcardprediction
Problem Description This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments . From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments

Objective: The objective of this project is to predict credit card defaults among customers in the upcoming months.

Definition of Credit Card Default: A credit card default occurs when a cardholder becomes severely delinquent on their credit card payments. Missing payments consistently, particularly failing to pay the Minimum Amount Due for several consecutive months, leads to a default.

Conclusion: This project evaluates the performance of various models in predicting credit card defaults. Among the models tested, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated the highest performance, achieving a recall score of 0.95 on the test set. Gradient Boosting and XGBoost followed closely with recall scores of 0.93 and 0.92, respectively. To mitigate overfitting across multiple models, techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were employed. These approaches resulted in noticeable improvements in model performance, as evidenced by the comparison of scores before and after implementation.
